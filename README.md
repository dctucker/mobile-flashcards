# Mobile Flashcards
(final project for React Native by dctucker)

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Expo has been installed locally and optionally on your phone
- XCode has been set up with Simulator running a recent version of iOS.
  - The iOS emulator from `yarn start` should be enough to run Simulator
- Android SDK has been installed (minimum version 27)
  - To run on Android, it's best to use Genymotion
  - Launch the Emulator from Genymotion before attempting to launch the Android device emulator from within `yarn start`

### Run these to launch the project

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

The QR code will show on the screen when Yarn is done starting up. Then you can
scan the QR code in your phone using Expo, or press `a` or `i` to launch
Emulator or Simulator, respectively.
